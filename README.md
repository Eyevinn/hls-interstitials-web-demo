# HLS Interstitials web demo

HLS interstitials is preliminary specification by apple for "stitching" multiple media content streams together, see [here](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/GettingStartedWithHLSInterstitials.pdf).

HLS interstitials is currently only supported in a few places and the web is not one of them.

This is a simple PoC implementation of HLS Interstitials on the web using existing technologies proving that HLS interstitials _can_ in fact be used today!

**Supported browsers**

- [x] Safari
- [ ] Chrome/Firefox/Edge - in progress!
